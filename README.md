Hi there! This is a mirror of our solutions, we share a c9 container to code in realtime, while
we train our computer programming skills using python, javascript and some some times in c++. 

The idea is to get better for technical interviews remote and onsite. 
If you want to join us, contact with us, we try to be cool :smile: :beer:
If you want you can help us improving our code.

Happy coding!
DreamTeam
